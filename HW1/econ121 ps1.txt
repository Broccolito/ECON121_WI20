*1. beta 1 interprets that we expect when education change by 1 unit, log wage changes by beta 1 unit.
*   if education and experience are exogenous, when education change by 1 unit, log wage will exactly change by beta 1 unit.
*	The equation has a squared term because this is not a linear regression. 


*2. generate a log of hourly wage variable using "gen"
gen lhrwage=log(incwage/(uhrsworkt*wkswork1))
*	use "gen" to get dummy variable. I let white=1 when person is white, white=0 when person is black, white=2 when person is other race. 
gen white=1 if race==100
replace white=0 if race==200
replace white=2 if race!=100&race!=200


*	generate new education variable to measure years of schooling using "gen" 
*	assign education categgory into years of schooling
 gen ed=educ
 label var ed "years of schooling"
replace ed=0 if ed==0
replace ed=0 if ed==999
replace ed=0 if ed==1
replace ed=0 if ed==2
replace ed=2.5 if ed==10
replace ed=1 if ed==11
replace ed=2 if ed==12
replace ed=3 if ed==13
replace ed=4 if ed==14
replace ed=5 if ed==21
replace ed=5.5 if ed==20
replace ed=6 if ed==22
replace ed=7 if ed==31
replace ed=7.5 if ed==30
replace ed=8 if ed==32
replace ed=9 if ed==40
replace ed=10 if ed==50
replace ed=11 if ed==60
replace ed=12 if ed==70
replace ed=12 if ed==71
replace ed=12 if ed==72
replace ed=12 if ed==73
replace ed=13 if ed==80
replace ed=14 if ed==81
replace ed=14 if ed==90
replace ed=14 if ed==91
replace ed=14 if ed==92
replace ed=15 if ed==100
replace ed=16 if ed==110
replace ed=16 if ed==111
replace ed=17 if ed==120
replace ed=17 if ed==121
replace ed=18 if ed==122
replace ed=18 if ed==123
replace ed=18 if ed==124
replace ed=21 if ed==125

*	generate "potential experience" using "gen"
gen exper=age-ed-5
*	generate experience^2 
gen exper2=exper^2
* drop anyone who worked fewer than 50 weeks or fewer than 35 hours in a typical week, then summary the data using "sum".
keep if wkswork1>=50
keep if uhrsworkt>=35
sum


*3. use regression to estimate Mincerian Wage Equation. We can get the coefficient of education is about 0.0181593.
reg lhrwage ed exper exper2,r


*4. use reg to get the estimate return to education slightly increase after controlling for race and sex.
reg lhrwage ed exper exper2 white sex,r

*5. use "di" to get t test, the result is much lager than 1.69. The black-white wage log gap is statistically different from female-male log wage gap.
* t test:
di (.1318602-.1281831)/(.0019875+.0019846)

*6. By looking at the lable of sex, we can know sex=1 is male, sex=2 is female. Then use "reg" to get regression separately. The coefficient of education between these two regression is different. 
reg lhrwage ed exper exper2 white if sex==1
reg lhrwage ed exper exper2 white if sex==2
di .1466416-.1217907

*7. 
gen male=sex
replace male=1 if sex==1
replace male=0 if sex==2
gen maleXed = male*ed
reg lhrwage ed exper exper2 white male maleXed
* I get the same answer from question 6.
* use delta method and test significant different from 1:
nlcom _b[ed]/(_b[ed]+_b[maleXed])
di (1.243532-1)/.0335021
* use bootstrap and test significant different from 1:
bootstrap ratio=(_b[ed]/(_b[ed]+_b[maleXed])), reps (99): reg lhrwage ed exper exper2 white male maleXed
di (1.243532-1)/.0342706
* Both methods suggest that ratio is significantly different from 1.

* 8. SD with sampling weight is smaller than without sampling weight.
* 	 Teenagers are age from 13 to 19. 
  sum black hisp
  sum black hisp [pw=perweight]
* Summary with using sampling provide unbiased estimates. Because with sampling weight, the data can be undersample, the mean and SD both decrease.

*9. use "gen" to generate log hourly wage. Then "gen" a new age variable as "age07", using age79+28, meaning age in 2007. Then I generate potential experience as "exper", exper=age07-educ-5. Then generate "exper2"=exper^2.
gen lhrwage=log(laborinc07/hours07)
gen age07=age79+28
label var age07 "age in 2007"
gen exper=age07-educ-5
gen exper2=exper^2
* drop anyone who work less than 1750 hours.
keep if hours07>1750
* After generation, estimate Mincerian Wage Equation with sampling weight.
reg lhrwage educ exper exper2 hisp male [pw=perweight],r
* estimate Mincerian Wage Equation without sampling weight.
reg lhrwage educ exper exper2 hisp male,r
* after using sampling weight, the coefficient of education and SE both slightly increase.
* I would prefer to use sampling weight. Because this data set oversample race and ethnicity. By using sampling weight, it can reduce the effect of each black and hispanic and remove bias. 

*10. Return of education in both data is similar, but return of experience are different between these two data.

*11. No, I don't think it represents the causual effect of education. It correlates to log wage but not cause log wage. Because there are many other variables not include in this regression. For example, parents' education and family income and so on. 

*12. We can add "afqt81" and "urban14" into regression to test the correlation. 
reg lhrwage educ exper exper2 hisp male afqt81 urban14
* we can see "urban14" is not statistically significant. But afqt81 is statistically significant.

*13. Based on the result from this data, there are many omitted variables in this regression. It is hard to use OLS to deliver causal estimates of the return to education.
